Backup for docker containers PostgreSQL and volumes to S3

## Restore

Use the `restore` script to restore a file from S3.

Assuming  you ran the image with `-e BACKUP_S3_BUCKET=mybucket -e
BACKUP_S3_INSTANCE=myinstance` and you want to restore the file
`s3://mybucket/myinstance/some/file.tar.gz.enc` into `/root/restored` in the
container, just run:

    docker exec -it backup_container restore some/file.tar.gz.enc /root/restored

The file will be downloaded, decrypted and uncompressed for you. :wink:
